# Procedural terrain generation with OpenGL

This project was completed for the “Introduction to computer graphics” course.  The course focused on rendering techniques and their theoretical basis while leaving to the students the task to learn how to actually implement those techniques in OpenGL. The initial goal was to generate a landscape using procedural techniques and add some basic lighting effects to it.

Several features were implemented in addition to the basic requirements:

* Infinite terrain generation
* Dynamic shadows
* Adaptive level of details through the use of tessellation
* Instantiated patches of grass
* 3D model loading
* Dynamic sky which mimics the natural colour changes throughout the day
